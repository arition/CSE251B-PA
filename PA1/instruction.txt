PA1 Code implementation instruction:

Main body: PA1.ipynb
Dataloading, preprocessing and cross validation: cross_validation.py
Logistic_regression: logistic_regression.py
Softmax_regression: softmax_regression.py
Accuracy and plotting: utils.py

Instructs: We encapsulated different functions into differnt files accordingly,
and the main body of our program can be found in the PA1.ipynb. Each cell
are independent from each other hence running any of them would give the
corresponding sub-quiestion's result.
