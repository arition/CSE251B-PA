For each model, simply run the corresponding starter file would give the result.

For baseline model, run the 'starter.py'

For improved baseline model
    1) for the mirror flip method, run 'starter_flip.py'
    2) for the rotate method, run 'starter_rotate.py'
    3) for the weighted loss, run 'starter_rotate_weighted.py'
    
For the final part
    1) for our own solution, run 'starter_MyModel.py'
    2) for transfer learning, run 'starter_Transfer.py'
    3) for Unet, run 'starter_Unet'
